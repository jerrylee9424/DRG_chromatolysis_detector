# DRG_chromatolysis_detector
We identified chromatolysis in Dorsal Root Ganglion of rat lumbar foraminal stenosis. And we employed a Mask-RCNN model with a ResNet-50 backbone to conduct our experiments. This model enabled us to detect DRG chromatolysis in H&amp;E staining slides and categorize it into three types: central chromatolysis, segmental chromatolysis, and normal neurons
